Lab 1 - The Solex Agitator
==========================

1. Identify the function of all four stages and explain how each works
    - Astable Multivibrator
    - Amplifier
    - Integrators 


2. How would you convert the final sine wave to a square wave? 
    - We know that we integrated a square wave twice in ordr to get the final sine wave. Therefore, we could differentiate twice again to get back to a square wave. However, due to steady state error in integration, there is a good chance there will be some noise (?). 

3. How would you increase the maximum frequency of the circuit? 
    - The amplifier is a standard inverting amplifier, which means that 
   V_out is directoy proportional to the ratio of R2/R1. If we increase the value of R2, which is our potentiometer, we will increase the amplitude of the circuit. 

4. What is the function of the zener diodes? 
    - I thought we didn't use them?
